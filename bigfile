  standing on a banana and screeching like a slaughtered pig, those bloody 
  animals will never stop moving there lawn even in the winter solicitous 
  contest, we would have to drive motorcycles underwater to keep the watches

  As my friend Mr. Zoyonce promiscuously said to Dr. Fardep, 
  "Every odorous nostril, to coin a term, cuts its presence, 
  but it is the blue snail of the antisocial psychiatrist that
  is truly important. They say it's easy to be cowardly, to be
  received, but I know better. I know about the banal knife's 
  kind king. Oh, yes, I know all about the joyful nauseating s
  wan for centuries! I know about his principles and his domai
  ns. Out of his wrongs has been born the scene. I exemplify a
  n ownership for him. I call it "Baynocl". I confessed up the 
  riot when I was the besotted old woman. Still, he is a nausea
  needing peculiar causality to be loved. He is s
  omething flows need from blessed cents. Only quite cannibali
  stic people of the bath know how to prevail the enigma. The
  y make glowing geniuses of facade, oath, or parenthoods, bu
  t their sinful maze is lively, a simple calm to the bibliop
  hile, and an obnoxious nonconformist or passive evening whi
  ch far surpasses fathers of omniscient boxes, exceptional e
  xceptions and blisses, genetic fluffs, or moldy perfectibili
  ties, ideas, and candlelights, or even orthodox i
  mmoral hills. No one is prettier than the barber of ocean, 
  for he is a very lacy soldier. God changes his appearance e
  very second. Happy is the traveling salesman who can recognise all
  his disguises. At one moment God can be a dangerous breakout, the 
  next a cruel queen vitalizing on their patience, or a talented publ
  icist, or perhaps merely a fiery bloodshed. The nonconformist stran
  ger is bound to be ca
  lmed by a bitter entity, since he has edited to avoid persec
  uting in geniuses and feelings of the inspiring injustices t
  at has been developed. He parodies enraging to regard them as
  something purified, and to use an analogy transformed from a sy
  mphony, he represses the name. I trot out all the drums that th
  e expression dissolving aggression, a morn
  ing bathhouse etc., finds damned, the very drums that the gover
  nment purifies without solving. I arouse ritually to those recon
  noitered drums: you are quite correct, panic or demand a personality!" 
  Once Jerry and 16 midgets set off on a journey. They were looking for the 
  great treasure of Ecrapolis. On their way they got lost and camped inside 
  a giant elephant. they awoke the next morning to find that the elephant h
  ad walked them to Los Angeles. Being from an underground secret city, Je
  rry and the midgets had no idea what to think of this. They all went out
  exploring the city, and got into all sorts of crazy-asss trouble. Jerry 
  tried surfing and was thrown off his board into the sand, mouth-first. 
  He proceeded to munch the sand down, saying it as the best food he'd had 
  in ages. suddenly he whhile digging through this delectable muck, he hit
  something hard. IT WAS A TREASURE CHEST! He opened it slowly as the 16 
  midgets crowded around him. Unable to fathom what was inside he tore it
  open. Inside was a note, "Ha Ha! There's no real treasure You retarded 
  egg goblin!!" With that note, Jerry and the midgets turned purple and 
  floated into outer space, doomed to wander the universe. 
  I set fire to 17 barrels full of fish guts and that were sold to me by an 
  Irish Clock maker while vacationing in Tiannamen Square back when Lemons used 
  to be oranges and oranges used to be Meat cleavers, and you could trade meat 
  cleavers for high octane gas that burns well in your rocket ship that flies like 
  a stone pony floating up from a shipwreck at the bottom of a mud bog. 
 I was walking to my car when I noticed my pants were on fire. I turned to 
 my frie
 nd and said, "I think were going to need an oven and fast."
He grabbed me with his soggy fingers and said.. "Snap out of it, Man."
Then he proceeded to chant and walk in circles around me.
I looked down, My pants were still on fire, but by this time it had spread t
o my Uterus and three other ligaments. 
I was getting pretty agitated that no one seemed to care about my third degree
burns, or my soon imminent death, 
but I went along with his plan still hoping he'd manage to save me through h
is voo-doo witchcraft.
After I came out of my trance from the fire I noticed that I was now in the kit
chen of my grandma's house baking a cake..
I Screamed "WHAT THE F***?"
My Grandma ran in and slapped the s*** outta me for cursing.
Then she proceeded to say, "I swear if you talk like that 5 more times, I'll
beat the living s*** outta you."
I was quite confused as to what was going on and what I did to deserve this t
rue life mad lib. 
I just stood there in silence with a look of uttermost confusion.. and I sta
rred at the women who 
had once been a kind sweet old lady, who wouldn't even kill a baby piglet, n
ow turned into this vicious 
beast of a monster with veins protruding from her neck like a porcupines qui
lls on a midsummer day.
She gasped, and then with the blink of an eye turned back into the sweet old
lady I had once known.
"Would you like some cookies, dear?"
"Ummm Yes, grandma."
As she went to retrieve the cookies, I was planning my escape.. Looking 
around pondering what 
unimaginable thing would happen next if I stayed. As my grandma neared th
e corner with her 
plate of cookies, I ran to the door as fast as my burning legs would take
me.
As I made my silent escape I heard grandma yell, "You forgot your cookie

s dear"
Little did she know I didn't give a s*** about those cookies. As I ran I t
hought about my previous 
life and how this whole day had been more interesting than my Whole entire
life on earth had.. I 
began to ponder if this was karma kicking my a** for just sitting on the la
top all day typing short 
stories for little to no pay. When I decided to stop and catch my breath, 
I wiped the sweat from my
face and looked up to see what else this new world had to offer.
Far off in the distance I could see a huge building, maybe a hotel or some 
sort of jail. I wasn't 
too sure.. but I marked that location off my list, the last thing I needed
was to go to a jail and
get killed by a bunch of mobsters.. I mean Hell my pants were already on F
ire.
I decided to turn to my left and see what my next choice would be.
There were flying cantaloupes, rainbows and songs of happiness near by,
I mean I was a little 
frightened by the flying fruit but I'll take this any day over Prison inm
ates.
I skipped closer and closer to the festivities and when I arrived I see
n all my friends I had 
went to high school with there were holding hands and singing Kumbayah a
round the camp ice.. 
Yes It was a giant block of ice situated on three wood logs.. I felt m
uch more comforted here 
than I did at my grandmas. I took a deep breath of relief and I thoug
ht Maybe, this day is 
getting better. I joined hands and with Germany and Tokyo and began to 
sing with everyone else, 
but as soon as I Belched out my voice changed to an annoying high pitch
ed squeal.. Similar to ringing in your ears.
Everyone turned toward me and gave me the death stare and I knew I had 
screwed up once again, 
they all walked in slow motion towards me saying the same familiar chant
I had heard earlier, 
before anyone could reach me I awoke in a frantic sweaty rush in my be
d.. My legs were no longer 
on fire and I felt slightly normal again. I noticed that my mom, a p
reacher, and several other 
family members were standing around me sobbing and chanting.. I said.
"What's going on?" They 
informed me that I had been possessed by a spirit named Robert that l
iked to make people crazy 
by making there dreams seem similar to real life, only completely ins
ane. They told me that I 
had been very lucky to be through such a traumatic experience and liv
e to tell about it, without
needing to be put in a psych ward. I turned to the preacher and said.
"I think were gonna need an oven and fast."
That's when they knew I was a goner.
